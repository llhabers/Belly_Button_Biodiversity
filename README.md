## Situation - Belly Button Bacteria
I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.<br>

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.<br>

## Task
1. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.<br>
2. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.<br>
3. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.<br>
4. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.<br>
5. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.<br>

## Action
Please review my starter code for the action steps.

## Results
